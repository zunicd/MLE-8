Too many epochs can lead to overfitting and too few may result in an underfit model.\n","- With EarlyStopping we can specify an arbitrary large number of training epochs and stop training once the model performance on the validation dataset stops improving.\n","- Because model performance could fluctuate, we add a stopping delay in term of number of epochs without improvement (“patience”). \n","- After training interruption, we will not get the best model.
