# Fuel efficiency prediction

Provided with the classic [Auto MPG](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg) dataset, we will predict the **fuel efficiency** of the late-1970s and early 1980s automobiles, leveraging features such as cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, etc. 

It is a very small dataset and there are only a few features. We will first build a linear model and a neural network, evaluate their performances, and then leverage an auto-machine learning (AutoML) library called [TPOT](https://github.com/EpistasisLab/tpot) to see how it can be used to search over many ML model architectures.

# Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you will be able to

- understand the core building blocks of a neural network
- understand what dense and activation layers do
- build, train, and evaluate neural networks
- perform AutoML to search for optimal tree-based pipeline for a regression task 

Note: [State of Data Science and Machine Learning 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle-survey-2021) by Kaggle shows that the most commonly used algorithms were linear and logtistic regressions, followed closely by decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines (are you surprised?). Multilayer perceptron, or artificial neural networks are not yet the popular tools for tabular/structured data; see more technical reasons in papers: [Deep Neural Networks and Tabular Data: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01889), [Tabular Data: Deep Learning is Not All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03253). For this assignment, the main purpose is for you to get familiar with the basic building blocks in constructing neural networks before we dive into more specialized neural network architectures.

# Pre-work
For this assignment, we will use Google Colab. All the dependencies will be installed inside the assignment notebook. 

If you are not familiar with Google Colab, do an exercise: upload [imports.ipynb](imports.ipynb) to your Google Drive,  open it in Google Colab, and make sure of no errors when running all the cells. Refer to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or contact an instructor for assistance.
